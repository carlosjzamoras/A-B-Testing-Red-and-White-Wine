# A-B-Testing-Red-and-White-Wine
## Introduction 
In this case study, red and white wine quality was analayzed from their respective data sets. The wine samples are from the north of Portugal.

The data sets contain a quality rating, from a scale of 1 to 10, for each individual sample. 

## Data Set 

### Source 
  The two data sets are related to **red and ** white variants of the Portoguese 'Vinho Verde' wine. Due to 
  privacy and logistic issues, only physiochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are  
  available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brands, wine selling price, etc.).

### Variable Information

Variables:
(based on physicochemical tests)
  * fixed acidity
  * volatile acidity
  * citric acid
  * residual sugar 
  * chlorides
  * free sulfur dioxide
  * total sulfur dioxide
  * density
  * pH
  * sulphates
  * alcohol  
(based on sensory data)
  *quality (score between 0 and 10)

** Problem Statement
Our client is concerned with  assessing the quality of red and white wine. Specifically, determining if there is a significant difference in the quality between the two types of wine. The findings could lead to changes in material orders, wine selection availability to customers, and potential changes in the cultivating procress. 

This data sent has been traditionally used for classification and regression modeling. The goal of this project is to apply A/B Hypothesis Testing and provide business oriented recommendations based on this result.
